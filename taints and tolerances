Taints will repel all pods that are scheduled unless they have a matching toleration.
==================

Taints:     dedicated=inception:NoSchedule  (from example)
taints:            dedicated=notaerostat:NoSchedule   (??? just an idea)


matching toleration

tolerations:          (from example) this will allow the pod above to schedule on
 -key: "dedicated"                   that node because the pod has the matching
  operator: "Equal"                  toleration
  value: "inception"
  effect: "NoSchedule"

  tolerations:
   -key: "dedicated"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "notaerostat"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
