Spinnaker is a Continuous Delivery platform

It can automate deployments on different clour providers:
  - AWS EC2, Google Compute/Container/App Engine
    Azure, Openstack, and Kubernetes.
Works only for immutable (cloud-native) apps.
 - Forces you to deploy the whole app suite each time.

 Created at NetFlix

 - Also integrates with Continuous Integration tools (Jenkins, Travis), with
   monitoring tools, and provides different deployment strategies.
 * Can use Jenkins for your continuous build process and then Spinnaker can kick
   off your deployment.
    Can trigger from a Docker Build.

2 Cores sets of features:

Cluster Management:
  - View and manage your cluster resources in the cloud or in this case - K8s.

Deployment Management:
 - Create and manage continuous delivery workflows
 -  - This is where you create the delivery pipeline.

Deployment Strategies:
----------------------

Red/black -  ( or blue / green)

  - You have a series of pods with the old code and some with the new code with a load balancer
  That at some point switches the traffic from the Red Pods to the Black pods.


Rolling Red/black -

 - Same as Red Black but you don't need two complete sets of pods, the load balancer
   routes some traffic to the new Red pods and then slowly converts all the other pods.

Canary - Analysis - a different environment that gets some traffic
  - gets manual approval and then deploys to Prod using Red/Black strategy.

  - This give you the added benefit of being able to test the new pods before
    committing to all the changes and you can trigger a roll back if they don't work.
  This is how NetFlix and other big companies deploy.
