Authentication Basic HTTP

By default x509 certificates are used to authenticate yourself to the Kubernetes api-server.

These certificates were issued when your cluster was setup for the first time.

 - if you are using minikube or kops, this was done for you.
 - In the first k8s course it has how to create new users by generating new
 certificates signing them with the Certificate Authority that is used by Kubernetes.

Alternatives:

K8s API server is baed on HTTP so one of the options is use basic HTTP Basic Authentication.

HTTP Basic Authentication ony requries sending a username and possword to teh API server.
 - Simple to do, it is less secure and is difficult to maintain within K8s.

 To enable - use a static password file on the K8s Master.
 This path needs to be passed to the apiserver as an argument;

  --basic-auth-file=/path/to/somefile

  Format:

  password,user,uid,"group1,group2,group3"

  Downside:
  - Supported as a convenience while the K8s team is working on making the more
  secure methods easier to use.

  To add a user or change the password, the apiserver needs to be restarted.

  Most tools don't support basic auth.
