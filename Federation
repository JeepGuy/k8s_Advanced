See first K8s course for initial information.

Federation can be used to manage multiple clusters:
 - Can sync resources across clusters
  -- The same deployment version will run on cluster A and Cluster B
- Can perform cross cluster discovery
  -- One DNS record / Virtual IP (VIP) for a resource spanning multiple
    clusters.

Can help to achieve High Availability
(spreading the load across clusters, enabling failover between clusters)


Reasons to run multiple clusters:
- Lower latency for distributed customers
  -- (bring app geographically closer to the cluster)
- Fault isolation when physical hardware (or a rack/zone) fails
- Scale beyond the limitations of one cluster
- Run clusters in a hybrid cloud environment
  -- One cluster can run o premises, with failover to a cloud.

Since Kubernetes 1.5 you can use a tool called kubefed to administer your clusters

Kubefed can:
  - Add / Remove cluters
  - Deploy a Kubernetes federation control pane
