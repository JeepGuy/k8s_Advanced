Packaging with Helm
===================
- Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes
- Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications
- Helm is maintained by the CNCF - The Cloud Native Computing Foundation
  (Together with Kubernetes, fluentd, linkerd, and others)
- Started by Google and Deis
  Deis proveds a PaaS (Platform as a Service) on K8s
  Bought by Microsoft in April 2017.
  Now can be used without Deis.


Charts
------
Helm uses a packaging format called charts
 - A chart is a collection of files that describe a set of Kubernetes resources.
 - A single chart can deploy and app, or a database.
 - It can have dependencies, e.g. to install wordpress chart, you need a
   mysql chart.

 - Charts use templates that are typically developed by a package maintainer.
 - They will generate yaml files that Kubernetes understands
 - You can think of templetes as dynamic yaml files, which can contain logic
   and variables.

 Overriding values (variables) can be useful to make sure the app is configured
 in a way you want.
