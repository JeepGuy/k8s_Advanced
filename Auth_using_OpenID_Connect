Authentication using OpenID

Using OpenID Connect Tokens
- OpenID Connect is built on top of OAuth2
- It allows you to securely authenticate and ten receive an ID Token
- This ID Token can be verified whether it really originated from the authentication
  server, because it is signed using HMAC, SHA256 or RSA.
   (Signing algorithm or Encryption algorithm.)

This is a server that is outside of Kubernetes - a server that you set up yourself.
 - It gives k8s a token and then k8s can validate whether it is valid and
   really came from the authentication server.

The ID Token is JSON Web Token (JWT)
 - JWT contains known fields like username and optionally groups.

Once the token is obtained it can be used as a credential to authenticate to the
apiserver
 - You can pass --token=<your_token> when authenticating kubectl commands
   or you can put it in your configuration file.
Kubectl can also autoatically renew your token_id when it expires.
 - This doesn't work will all identity providers.

 Using this token you can authenticate to the K8s UI (web ui)
  - which is the apiserver.

In the demo - to make this easier - create a reverse proxy that can authenticate
you using OpenID Connect and it will pass your token to the UI.
